# Chrona Physics

Chrona is a 2d JavaScript physics engine designed for developers who want precise control over motion and collisions. It models time continuously, calculates collisions exactly, and represents motion as affine transformations that evolve linearly over time.

There are a couple resources available in `/docs` for learning Chrona:

- the [overview](./docs/overview.md), which explains what Chrona is and who it's for.
- the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started.md), which explains how to use Chrona.
- the examples, available at `/docs/examples`.

To use Chrona, copy the `/chrona` directory into your project and import from `/chrona/index.mjs`.
